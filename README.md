AuctionHelper
=============
This is a simple app that can help run live auctions, specifically 
I use it for Fantasy Football drafts. With this, no one can complain
of auctioneer favoritism or unfairness. Online fantasy draft software
currently offered from major sites are focused on draft mechanics
and have horrible features such as auto-drafting that can produce
nonsensical lineups, and mess up drafting strategies.

This is my first Meteor app and it seemed like a good way to get my
feet wet using this new framework.
